# avionmesh - Home Assistant

This is a custom component that allows you to control Avi-on mesh based lights from Home Assistant.

This effectively replaces <https://github.com/oyvindkinsey/avionmqtt> in favor of using <https://github.com/oyvindkinsey/avionmesh> and <https://github.com/oyvindkinsey/avionmesh> directly.
